# Graphing Libraries
## Libraries for plotting cool graphs and charts
There are lots of python libraries that we can use to help visualise our data with graphs and charts. 
In this activity, we will be introduced to [plotly](https://plot.ly/python/), [GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org/),
[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), and [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)


* ### [plotly](https://plot.ly/python/)
Plotly express offers some built in datasets which we can use to learn about creating charts.
