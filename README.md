# Data Visualisation with the Belfast Trees Dataset
## A Workshop by Coffee&Code Belfast

# Intro to workshop

# Setup
We will be using Google CoLab for today's challenge. A CoLab notebook is an interactive environment that allows you to easily write Python and use Python libraries, ideal for Data Science and Visualisation projects. If you're new to CoLab, you can learn more about it [here](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#)

New to Python? Check out some beginner resources to get you started:

* [Python beginner tips](https://realpython.com/python-beginner-tips/)

* [Intro to Python](https://docs.python-guide.org/intro/learning/)

* [Freecodecamp - Python](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/python/)

## Tasks
* [Task 1](markdown/task_001.md) is all about how we can use python to look at data
* [Task 2](markdown/task_002.md) is all about graphing libraries that we can use to visualise our data
* [Task 3](markdown/task_003.md) is all about libraries that we can use to better structure our data and libraries that are useful for maths
* [Task 4](markdown/task_004.md) is all about visualising the Belfast trees dataset
